# ü§ñ 6-DOF Robotic Arm Simulation in Gazebo, RViz & MoveIt

[![ROS](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS-Noetic-blue.svg)](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic)


This repository provides a ROS-based simulation of a 6-DOF robotic arm for pick-and-place operations. It uses **Gazebo** for realistic physics simulation, **RViz** for real-time visualization, and **MoveIt** for motion planning and trajectory execution. The robot is fully modeled using URDF and integrates with ROS control interfaces for trajectory execution.
